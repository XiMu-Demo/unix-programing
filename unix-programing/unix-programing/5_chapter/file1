PENSACOLA, FloridaÔºçThe Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola Naval Air Station had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast US support of Israel and accuse the United States of being anti-Muslim, a US official said on Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption that it was a terrorist attack.

The FBI is also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lieutenant Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.

Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy during the rampage at a classroom building on Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign military forces routinely receive instruction.

"We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," said Rachel J.Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Jacksonville.

Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the US under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Also, investigators believe the killer had visited New York City, including the Rockefeller Center, days before the shooting and are working to determine the purpose of the trip, the official said.

All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi commanding officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.
